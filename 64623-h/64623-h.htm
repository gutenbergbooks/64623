<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> English version of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>,<a id="Pref_FNanchor_1" href="#Pref_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> translated from the
Chinese text of Kumarajiva, owes its inception to successive
conversations with a friend, profoundly interested in the
interpretation of oriental systems of philosophy. During those
conversations renderings into English were made of numerous passages
from the works of Confucius, Mencius, and Lao-Tsz.</p>

<p>Having surveyed briefly those fertile fields of thought, we passed, by
a natural transition, into the delectable Buddhist realm. Some
passages from the <cite>Chinese Sutras</cite>, comprising texts and annotations,
were consecutively examined, and variously considered. Eventually it
was suggested that <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, perhaps one of the most
metaphysical of the works ascribed to Buddha, be conveniently rendered
into the English language.</p>

<p>In order that the rather unfamiliar text might assume due
intelligibility, parallel passages and numerous annotations were
subjoined, as the pleasant work of translating proceeded. The idea of
printing and publishing the text seemed to follow as a natural sequence.</p>

<p>Already there exist in the English language, renderings of <cite>The Diamond
Sutra</cite> from the Sanscrit by Max Müller, and from the Chinese by Beal.
This new version does not seek to enter into rivalry with those
erudite works; and a possible apology which might readily be offered
for the publication of this modest volume is, that the scholarly
productions of Müller and Beal, in their present forms, are perhaps
slightly inaccessible to the general English reader.</p>

<p>It would appear that the peculiar charm of the Buddhist philosophy,
and the remarkable purity of the Buddhist faith, are becoming more
generally appreciated in Europe. Should this imperfect rendering of
<cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, even in the faintest degree, confirm this just
sense of appreciation, or prove a gentle incentive to further enquiry,
then its unexpected publication may prove to be not entirely
unjustified.</p>

<p>In recording our many obligations to those scholars whose works were
frequently consulted, we also give expression to a hope that nothing
of importance is omitted which ought to be gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>It may also be permissible to express admiration of the piety, and
appreciation of the friendship, of those learned monks in Central
China, to whom we are everlastingly indebted for even a slight
initiation into those inexhaustible truths, which are alike the
heritage, and the glory, of the disciples of Buddha. Amongst those we
should like to specify are Chang-Ming, the chief monk (Seng-Kwan) of
Chen-Chou prefecture, Hu-Nan, and the aged and affectionate Chioh-Hsien.</p>

A learned Chinese commentator thus explained the rather striking
title: “As the diamond exceeds all other precious gems in brilliance
and indestructibility; so, also, does the wisdom of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>
transcend, and shall outlive, all other knowledge known to philosophy.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>
The <cite>Diamond Sutra</cite> is one of the most valued and widely read
philosophical works in Buddhist literature. It is very popular amongst
ardent Buddhists in China, and excepting the <cite>Lotus of the Good Law</cite>,
and the <cite>Leng-Yen-Ching</cite>,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_1" href="#Intro_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> perhaps no other Sutra ascribed to Buddha
is regarded by the Chinese with so great esteem.</p>

<p>In Japan, <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> appears to be perused extensively by
what Max Müller<a id="Intro_FNanchor_2" href="#Intro_Fnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> termed the Shin-Gon sect, founded by Ko-Bo, a
disciple of the renowned pilgrim Hiuen-Tsang, about the year 816 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p><cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> was written originally in Sanscrit, and in process
of time translated into the Tibetan, Chinese, Mongol, and Manchu
languages. It represents the Mahayana school of Buddhist thought, a
school founded by Nagarjuna,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_3" href="#Intro_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> which flourished primarily at
Tchakuka, and thereafter influenced appreciably a considerable part of
the Buddhist Church.</p>

<p>In the year 1836, Csomo Körösi published an account of the Tibetan
translation, which interesting document may be consulted in Vol. XX.
of the <cite>Asiatic Researches</cite>. <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> is therein designated
“The Sutra of Wonderful Effects,” a treatise by means of which
Sakyamuni Buddha instructs Subhuti, one of his conspicuous disciples,
in <cite>The Prajna-Paramita</cite> of transcendent wisdom.<a id="Intro_FNanchor_4" href="#Intro_Fnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>To Kumarajiva,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_5" href="#Intro_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> a native of Kashmir, who gained distinction as a
monk of the later Chin dynasty<a id="Intro_FNanchor_6" href="#Intro_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 384–417), is conceded the
honour of having first translated <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> into the Chinese
language. Of subsequent Chinese translations, perhaps the most
noteworthy is the text ascribed to the scholarly <i>Hiuen-Tsang</i>, and
completed about the middle of the seventh century.<a id="Intro_FNanchor_7" href="#Intro_Fnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>A rendering into English of Kumarajiva’s Chinese translation was
accomplished by the Rev. S. Beal, and published in The <cite>Journal of the
Royal Asiatic Society</cite>, 1864–65. The text and German translation of
the Tibetan version were published in 1873 by M. Schmidt, in <cite>The
Mémoires de l’Académie St Pétersbourg</cite>. The Mongolian translation was
presented by the Baron de Constadt to the library of the Institut de
France. The Manchu translation is in the possession of M. de Harlez,
who, with the aid of the Tibetan, Manchu, and Chinese versions,
published a French translation of the Sanscrit text of <cite>The Diamond
Sutra</cite> in the <cite>Journal Asiatique</cite>, 1892.<a id="Intro_FNanchor_8" href="#Intro_Fnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It has been observed<a id="Intro_FNanchor_9" href="#Intro_Fnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
that “at first sight it may seem as if this metaphysical treatise
hardly deserved the world-wide reputation which it has attained.”
Regarding this descriptive “world-wide reputation,” devout Buddhists
might suggest in extenuation, that throughout many centuries, the
“spiritual wisdom” of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> produced in countless minds
a “conscious blessedness of perfect peace.” This “spiritual wisdom”
also appeared to be a “strong incentive to holiness,” and a grateful
inspiration to those who had entered “the path which leads to
Nirvana.” In a few renowned monasteries of Central China, our Buddhist
friends frequently affirmed that, by contemplating the “spiritual
wisdom” of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, the mind would inevitably become
“transfused with the mellow light of imperishable truth.”</p>

<p>In the preface to <cite>The Vagrakkhedika</cite>, Max Müller made a critical
observation regarding certain peculiarities of “‘style’ adopted in
this treatise by the Buddhist philosophers who wished to convince
their hearers of the truth of their philosophy.” From the Sanscrit
text, perhaps it is difficult to realise fully what Asvaghocha<a id="Intro_FNanchor_10" href="#Intro_Fnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
described as the “persuasiveness of Buddha’s eloquence”;<a id="Intro_FNanchor_11" href="#Intro_Fnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> yet we may
quite appreciate the academic instinct of Kumarajiva, whose work on
<cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> bears evidence of a laudable endeavour to produce
a classic, which in the Chinese language is almost entirely beyond
reproach.</p>

<p>In all our aspirations to translate or to interpret Buddhist texts,
perhaps it might prove advantageous to bear in mind the significant
words incorporated in the <cite>Light of Asia</cite>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>And time hath blurred their script and ancient sense,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Which once was new and mighty, moving all.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Max Müller stated<a id="Intro_FNanchor_12" href="#Intro_Fnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> that <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> represents a treatise on
“metaphysical agnosticism,” and he excused its “endless repetition of
the same process of reasoning” on the assumption, that the
subject-matter of the <i>Sutra</i> was probably “perfectly familiar to
children and ignorant persons.”</p>

<p>By referring to our Chinese text, we are led to suppose that <cite>The
Diamond Sutra</cite> was “delivered expressly for those who had entered the
Path which leads to Nirvana,” and for those who are “attaining to the
ultimate plane of Buddhic thought.” Our Chinese annotators also appear
to be unanimous in suggesting, that the “spiritual wisdom” of <cite>The
Diamond Sutra</cite> is understood only in its rudimentary forms, by those
of immature or uninitiated mind.</p>

<p>Concerning what has been termed the “agnosticism” of <cite>The Diamond
Sutra</cite>, Sakyamuni Buddha, when he admissibly delivered the text,
indicated clearly that there is a sense in which the “highest perfect
knowledge”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_13" href="#Intro_Fnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> may be referred to as “unknown.” Dante appears to have
had a similar difficulty regarding “knowledge” and “power” wherewith
to express the higher forms of spiritual experience; and the following
lines, constituting the opening stanzas of <cite>The Paradiso</cite>, may serve
to elucidate the Buddhist position, and make it perhaps more
intelligible to those who are as yet unfamiliar with its peculiar
modes of thought:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container" xml:lang="it">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>La gloria di colui che tutto move</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Per l’universo penetra, e risplende</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>In una parte più, e meno altrove.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Nel ciel che più della sua luce prende</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Fu’io; e vidi cose che ridire</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Nè sa nè può qual di lassù discende;</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Perchè, appressando sè al suo disire,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Nostro intelletto<a id="Intro_FNanchor_14" href="#Intro_Fnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> si profonda tanto,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Che retro la memoria non può ire.</i>”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_15" href="#Intro_Fnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>In order to appreciate fully the philosophy of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>,
doubtless it is necessary to interpret aright the meaning of the
Buddhist terminology. In this connection, the Sanscrit Dharma—usually
rendered into Chinese by “Fah,” and into English by “Law”—appears to
merit our immediate attention.</p>

<p>Max Müller, with his ample knowledge, stated that Dharma, “in the
ordinary Buddhist phraseology, may be correctly rendered by Law; and
thus the whole teaching of Buddha is named <i>Saddharma</i>—‘The Good Law.’
What <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> wishes to teach is that all objects,
differing one from the other by their Dharmas, are illusive, or as we
should say, phenomenal and subjective, that they are, in fact, of our
own making, the products of our own mind.” With those noteworthy
observations, there is embodied in the preface to <cite>The Vagrakkhedika</cite>,
the following interesting suggestion, that the Greek <span xml:lang="el">εῖδος</span>—whatever is
seen, form, shape, figure—appears to be the equivalent of the Sanscrit
Dharma.</p>

<p>Spence Hardy, a distinguished writer on Buddhism, made a suggestion of
perhaps equal importance, with reference to the correct interpretation
of Dharma. In his well-known volume <cite>Eastern Monachism</cite>, there occurs
the following relevant passage: “The second of the three great
treasures is called Dhammo, or in Singhalese Dharmma. This word has
various meanings, but is here to be understood in the sense of <em>truth</em>.”</p>

<p>Rhys Davids in his useful volume <cite>Buddhism</cite>, indicated that “Dharma
(Pali Dhamma) is not law, but that which underlies and includes the
law—a word often most difficult to translate, but best rendered here
by Truth and Righteousness.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_16" href="#Intro_Fnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it may be opportune to remark, that had Kumarajiva regarded
“form,” “truth,” or “righteousness,” as expressing adequately the
Sanscrit Dharma, these familiar terms being obviously at his command,
might have been utilised at pleasure. Like the cultured Asvaghocha,
Kumarajiva may have regarded the “nature” of the Law as “co-extensive
with the illimitable ocean of being”;<a id="Intro_FNanchor_17" href="#Intro_Fnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and within that ample
compass, perhaps he thought there might synthetically be included
those beautifully-defined concepts “form,” “truth,” and “righteousness.”</p>

<p>Chinese annotators of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> seldom criticise adversely
its classic terminology, or suggest many inapplicable alternative
renderings. They appear to have surveyed the realm of “spiritual
wisdom” enunciated by Sakyamuni Buddha, and thereafter to have become
greatly impressed by the thought that, in its <em>Essence</em>, it might
possibly be inexhaustible. This may in part explain their motive for
incorporating in the commentary a familiar passage from <cite>Lao-Tsz</cite>,
“Infinite truth is inexpressible”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_18" href="#Intro_Fnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>—which in a measure illustrates
the appreciable difficulty of stating, in exact terms of philosophy,
the equivalent of the Buddhic “Law.”</p>

<p>In our intercourse with Buddhist monks, we heard the rather engaging
suggestion, that the familiar Christian phrase, “the law of the spirit
of life,” contains a spiritual concept which appears to approximate
closely to the idea of the “Law” of Buddha. Those monks seemed to
believe that the “Law”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_19" href="#Intro_Fnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> enters quietly and operates imperceptibly
within every natural and spiritual sphere; and that they have at least
a semblance of reason for their belief, the following exquisite lines
clearly indicate:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>This is its touch upon the blossomed rose,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The fashion of its hand shaped lotus-leaves.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>That is its painting on the glorious clouds,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>And these its emeralds on the peacock’s train.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>Out of the dark it wrought the heart of man,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Out of dull shells the pheasant’s pencilled neck.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>It spreadeth forth for flight the eagle’s wings</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>What time she beareth home her prey.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<i>This is its work upon the things ye see</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The unseen things are more; men’s hearts and minds,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The thoughts of peoples and their ways and wills,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Those, too, the great Law binds.”</i><a id="Intro_FNanchor_20" href="#Intro_Fnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we consider the manifold operations of this “Law which moves to
righteousness,” perhaps we may gradually appreciate the dignified mind
of Sakyamuni, when he addressed Subhuti, saying: “What is usually
referred to as the ‘Law’ of Buddha, is not in reality a ‘Law’
attributive to Buddha, it is merely termed the ‘Law’ of Buddha.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_21" href="#Intro_Fnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The Sanscrit term Samgna,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_22" href="#Intro_Fnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> usually rendered into Chinese by “Ming”
and into English by “Name,” seems to deserve our further attention.
Like the term Dharma, a clear knowledge of “Samgna” is indispensable
for a correct understanding of our text.</p>

<p>In one of the opening passages of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, we find that
Sakyamuni Buddha, in reply to an enquiry by Subhuti, suggests that by
means of this “wisdom,” enlightened disciples shall be enabled to
bring into subjection every inordinate desire.</p>

<p>“<i>Every species of life, whether hatched in the egg, formed in the
womb, evolved from spawn, produced by metamorphosis, with or without
form or intelligence, possessing or devoid of natural instinct—from
these changeful conditions of being I command you to seek deliverance
in the transcendental concept of Nirvana. Thus you shall obtain
deliverance from the idea of an immeasurable, innumerable, and
illimitable world of sentient life; but, in reality there is no idea
of a world of sentient life from which to obtain deliverance. And why?
Because, in the mind of an enlightened disciple, there have ceased to
exist such arbitrary ideas of phenomena as an entity, a being, a
living being, or a personality.</i>”</p>

<p>A similar process of reasoning appears to permeate the whole of <cite>The
Diamond Sutra</cite>, and whether appertaining to a living being,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_23" href="#Intro_Fnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> a
virtue,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_24" href="#Intro_Fnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> a condition of mind,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_25" href="#Intro_Fnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> a Buddhist kingdom,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_26" href="#Intro_Fnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> or a
personal Buddha,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_27" href="#Intro_Fnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> there is implied in each concept a spiritual
essence, only imperfectly described, if not entirely overlooked, in
the ordinary use of each particular name. Shakespeare enquired,
“What’s in a name?” and in a thought inspired by the rose and its
delicious fragrance, suggested with Buddha, that there is little, or
nothing, in a name which explains the real nature of an object. Even a
“particle of dust” seems, to the Buddhist mind, to embody in its
composition a subtle spiritual element, entirely “inscrutable,” and
quite “incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>According to the Mahayana School of Buddhist thought, objects and
their respective names are alike unreal and illusory. Objects and
names, in the abstract, represent merely the products of untutored and
unenlightened minds. Nothing is real, in the sense that it is
permanent. Everything appears to be subject to irrevocable Laws of
change and decay. As the things which we see are temporal, it is
essential for our intellectual development, that we focus our thoughts
upon the things which are Unseen and Eternal. Many minds are
susceptible of deception by the fleeting phenomena of life; but behind
these phenomena there is an essential element, entirely spiritual,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_28" href="#Intro_Fnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
uninfluenced by arbitrary ideas or changeful conditions, which
“pervades all things,” and is “pure” and “unchanging.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it might prove of interest to quote the following outline of
Mahayana doctrine<a id="Intro_FNanchor_29" href="#Intro_Fnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> prepared by Mr S. Kuroda, which was approved by
several influential Buddhist communions in Japan, “and published with
authority at Tokyo in 1893”:—</p>

<p>“All things that are produced by causes and conditions are inevitably
destined to extinction. There is nothing that has any reality; when
conditions come things begin to appear, when conditions cease these
things likewise cease to exist. Like the foam of the water, like the
lightning flash,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_30" href="#Intro_Fnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and like the floating, swiftly vanishing clouds,
they are only of momentary duration. As all things have no constant
nature of their own, so there is no actuality in pure and impure,
rough and fine, large and small, far and near, knowable and
unknowable, etc. On this account it is sometimes said that all things
are nothing. The apparent phenomena around us are, however, produced
by mental operations within us, and thus distinctions are
established....”</p>

<p>“All things are included under subject and object. The subject is an
entity in which mental operations are awakened whenever there are
objects, while the object consists of all things, visible and
invisible, knowable and unknowable, etc. The subject is not something
that occupies some space in the body alone, nor does the object exist
outside of the subject....”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_31" href="#Intro_Fnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>“The various phenomena which appear as subjects and objects are
divided into two kinds:—the perceptible and knowable, the
imperceptible and unknowable.... Now, what are the imperceptible and
unknowable phenomena?”</p>

<p>“Through the influence of habitual delusions, boundless worlds,
innumerable varieties of things spring up in the mind. This boundless
universe and these subtle ideas are not perceptible and knowable;<a id="Intro_FNanchor_32" href="#Intro_Fnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
only Bodhisattvas<a id="Intro_FNanchor_33" href="#Intro_Fnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> believe, understand, and become perfectly
convinced of these through the contemplation of Vidyamatara<a id="Intro_FNanchor_34" href="#Intro_Fnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> (all
things are nothing but phenomena in mind); hence they are called
imperceptible and unknowable. What are the perceptible and knowable
phenomena?”</p>

<p>“Not knowing that these imperceptible and unknowable phenomena are the
productions of their own minds, men from their habitual delusions
invest them with an existence outside of mind, as perceptible mental
phenomena, as things visible, audible, etc. These phenomena are called
perceptible and knowable.”</p>

<p>“Though there are thus two kinds, perceptible and imperceptible
phenomena, they occur upon the same things, and are inseparably bound
together even in the smallest particle. Their difference in appearance
is caused only by differences, both in mental phenomena and in the
depth of conviction. Those who know only the perceptible things,
without knowing the imperceptible, are called the unenlightened by
Buddha....”</p>

<p>“In contradistinction to the fallacious phenomena, there is the true
Essence of Mind. Underlying the phenomena of mind, there is an
unchanging principle which we call essence of mind.... The essence of
mind is the entity without ideas and without phenomena, and is always
the same. It pervades all things, and is pure and unchanging.... The
essence and the phenomena of mind are inseparable; and as the former
is all-pervading and ever-existing, so the phenomena occur everywhere
and continually, wherever suitable conditions accompany it. Thus the
perceptible and imperceptible phenomena are manifestations of the
essence of mind that, according to the number and nature of
conditions, develop without restraint. All things in the universe,
therefore, are mind itself.”</p>

<p>“By this we do not mean that all things combine into a mental unity
called mind, nor that all things are emanations from it, but that,
without changing their places or appearance, they are mind itself
everywhere. Buddha saw this truth and said that the whole universe was
his own. Hence it is clear that where the essence of mind is found,
and the necessary conditions accompany it, the phenomena of mind never
fail to appear.... Though there is a distinction between the essence
and the phenomena of mind, yet they are nothing but one and the same
substance, that is, <em>mind</em>. So we say that there exists nothing but
mind. Though both the world of the pure and impure, and the generation
of all things, are very wide and deep, yet they owe their existence to
our mind.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we might appropriately indicate that however interesting, or
even fascinating, may be the nice distinction between <em>mind</em> and
<em>essence of mind</em>, in relation to phenomena, so far as we are aware,
the distinction may be implied, but is never precisely stated, in the
text of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>. Nevertheless, we may readily appreciate
the subtle intellectual movement, which endeavours to distinguish
clearly between the phenomena of mind, and an unchanging principle
underlying it, capable of being defined as Essence of Mind. Yet we
have a notion that our Japanese Buddhist friends intuitively find in
their beautiful concept, infinitely more of a purely spiritual nature,
than they attempt to express by the mere metaphysical term. Doubtless
they have frequently applied to it the incisive logic of Sakyamuni
Buddha, and found simultaneously, that what is ordinarily referred to
as “essence of mind,” is not in reality “essence of mind,” it is
merely termed “essence of mind.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_35" href="#Intro_Fnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>The term Buddha, as defined in <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, seems to merit a
brief consideration. In fulfilment of our present purpose, it seems
almost unnecessary to enter into questions regarding the historical
Buddha, or to the authenticity of Sutras ascribed to his genius.
Therefore, without indicating any particular reservation, we meantime
accept the traditional statements that the Buddha of <cite>The Diamond
Sutra</cite> was the son of Suddhodana, the husband of Yasodhara, and the
father of Rahula. But, incorporated with the text, there is embodied
in the familiar term Buddha, a lofty spiritual concept, which seems to
place it in a category where fresh interest is imparted to the
question of its interpretation.</p>

<p>Concluding the <a href="#Ch_26">twenty-sixth chapter</a> of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, wherein
“the spiritual<a id="Intro_FNanchor_36" href="#Intro_Fnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> body is entirely differentiated from external
phenomena” Sakyamuni, in reply to an enquiry regarding the possibility
of perceiving “Buddha” by means of his bodily distinctions, delivered
the following remarkable Gatha<a id="Intro_FNanchor_37" href="#Intro_Fnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse"><i>I am not to be perceived by means of any visible form,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Nor sought after by means of any audible sound;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Whosoever walks in the way of iniquity,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Cannot perceive the blessedness of the Lord Buddha.</i><a id="Intro_FNanchor_38" href="#Intro_Fnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the <a href="#Ch_29">twenty-ninth chapter</a> of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, wherein is
expounded “the majesty of the absolute,” Sakyamuni declared that a
disciple who affirms that “Buddha” comes or goes, obviously has not
understood the meaning of his instruction. Because, as we learn from
our text, the idea “Buddha” implies neither coming from anywhere, nor
going to anywhere. This purely spiritual concept of Buddha seems to
have seized the imagination, and inspired the writer of the
<cite>Yuen-Chioh Sutra</cite>,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_39" href="#Intro_Fnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> to whom are ascribed the following significant
lines:—</p>

<p>“<i>Like drifting clouds, like the waning moon, like ships that sail the
ocean, like shores that are washed away—these are symbolic of endless
change. But the blessed Buddha, in his essential, absolute nature, is
changeless and everlasting.</i>”</p>

<p>Again, in the <a href="#Ch_17">seventeenth chapter</a> of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, it is
declared that in the word “Buddha,” every Law is intelligibly
comprehended.<a id="Intro_FNanchor_40" href="#Intro_Fnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> To Western minds, it might become necessary to resist
a natural inclination to ascribe to those elements of thought, an
influence which had its inception in a nation other than the
Indian.<a id="Intro_FNanchor_41" href="#Intro_Fnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> But, lest we should appear to detract from the native glory
of Sakyamuni Buddha, perhaps it might prove opportune to remark, that
there is sufficient evidence in the ancient Vedic hymns, Upanishads,
etc., to indicate clearly the probable starting-points in the
evolution of his thought. It seems to be to the everlasting honour of
some early Indian philosophers, that they endeavoured carefully to
combine in an abstract spiritual unity, all the essential elements
usually comprehended under the term “Divinity.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_42" href="#Intro_Fnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> This may in a
manner explain why the devout Buddhist, possessing a natural mental
tendency—induced by persistent Hindoo influence—is enabled to regard
“Buddha”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_43" href="#Intro_Fnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> in a purely spiritual sense, as the One<a id="Intro_FNanchor_44" href="#Intro_Fnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> in whom all
Laws are comprehended and become perfectly intelligible.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite> it may be observed that incidental reference is
made by Sakyamuni Buddha to the doctrines of Karma and Reincarnation.
It seems to be an old truth to which expression is given in the
<cite>Epistle to the Galatians</cite>: “Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
life everlasting.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_45" href="#Intro_Fnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>To the Buddhist mind, Karma is indissolubly associated with “the Law
which moves to Righteousness.” Thus it is accustomed to view the
traditional Christian idea of “justification by Faith,” rather as a
devoutly-conceived theory, than as a reasonably-constructed truth.</p>

<p>Occasionally we have heard a gentle affirmation, that the Western mind
seems unwittingly inclined to confound the doctrine of Karma with a
concept which is almost suggestive of Fatalism. If Karma contains even
a germ of thought which corresponds to “blind fatalism,” the idea is
perhaps quite felicitously expressed in the following sentences,
culled from a valued letter written by an aged Chinese monk: “Karma is
a universal Law which gently binds us to the rhythmic cycle of
evolving life. It operates so quietly and imperceptibly that we
scarcely are conscious of its presence. The absolute truth of Karma
greatly attracts our minds, which approve naturally of its consummate
justice and perfect righteousness.”</p>

<p>Those ideas of “consummate justice” and “perfect righteousness,” seem
to be faithfully portrayed in the following quotation, gleaned from
<cite>The Light of Asia</cite>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>What hath been bringeth what shall be, and is,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Worse—better—last for first and first for last:</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The Angels in the Heavens of Gladness reap</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Fruits of a holy past.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It would therefore appear that Karma may be regarded generally, as
comprising the constituent moral elements derived consecutively from
the thoughts, words, and actions of an interminable life’s cycle.
Perhaps it is in this connection that Chinese Buddhists frequently
assume Karma to resemble “a moral fibre, indissolubly entwined in
sentient life.” It may be believed to recede far into the past, and to
extend indefinitely into the future.</p>

<p>Although realising the significance of Karma,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_46" href="#Intro_Fnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> the devout Buddhist
mind is not usually disturbed by fearful forebodings. Ostensibly, it
has evolved to a condition of holiness, wherein “the dross of sin” is
entirely consumed in the “white flames” of Sakyamuni’s “transcendent
wisdom” and “boundless love.”</p>

<p>Within the realm of Buddhist philosophy, the doctrine of
reincarnation is conspicuous by reason of its peculiarly attractive
charms. On first acquaintance, the European mind may be somewhat
“startled” to discover, that a satisfactory explanation of the
interminable evolution of life, is sought for by the earnest Buddhist
in the theory of reincarnation.</p>

<p>In the text of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, it may be observed that Sakyamuni
Buddha, in discoursing to Subhuti, referred incidentally to personal
reminiscences, one of which belonged to a distant period of five
hundred incarnations.</p>

<p>According to the text of <cite>The Light of Asia</cite>, the spiritual
consciousness of Sakyamuni Buddha extended to a period even more
remote, as may be judged by these remarkable lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>I now remember, myriad rains ago,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>What time I roamed Himâla’s hanging woods.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In considering briefly the doctrine of reincarnation, perhaps it might
readily be conceded to our Buddhist friends, that there were
exemplified in the Founder of their faith, a wonderful potency of
intellect, and a marvellous degree of spiritual intuition. Quite
agreeable, also, may be the suggestion, that this potency of intellect
might become intensified, and probably “rendered subjective,” by
“ascetic exercises,” abstract contemplation, and “determined effort.”</p>

<p>Spence Hardy indicated in <cite>Eastern Monachism</cite> that the Buddhist mind
conceives of “spiritual powers” arising from the aforementioned
“potency of intellect” and “spiritual intuition,” which in other
systems of religion are usually regarded as partaking of the nature of
“Divinity.” If it be admitted that those potential “powers” are
probably susceptible of affiliation with the Divine Spirit, then the
way of approach to an understanding of the Buddhist theory of
intuition becomes, perhaps, tolerably clear. Concrete knowledge
acquired by intuition, appears to assure our Buddhist friends of the
<em>fact</em> of reincarnation. But they invariably refrain from a vain
attempt to <em>prove</em> the “fact,” by an authorised—and consequently
stereotyped—process of reasoning.</p>

<p>The unknown Hindoo author of The <cite>Bhagavad-Gita</cite> revealed in simple
phraseology the native idea of reincarnation; and suggested, happily,
an instructive theory concerning the advent of great Teachers and
Saviours in every age. To Krishna are ascribed the following sayings;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>Manifold the renewals of my birth</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Have been.... When Righteousness</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Declines, O Bharata, when Wickedness</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Visible shape, and move a man with men,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>And setting Virtue on her seat again.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rhys Davids justly observed that “to the pious Buddhist it is a
constant source of joy and gratitude that ‘the Buddha,’ not only then,
but in many former births, when emancipation from all the cares and
troubles of life was already within his reach, should again and again,
in mere love for man, have condescended to enter the world, and live
amidst the sorrows inseparable from finite existence.”<a id="Intro_FNanchor_47" href="#Intro_Fnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Perhaps in a
more general sense the idea of reincarnation appealed strongly to the
imagination of Wordsworth, when he was inspired to write these
familiar, yet exquisite, lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The soul that rises with us, our life’s star,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Hath had elsewhere its setting</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>And cometh from afar.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Regarding the doctrines of Individuality and non-Individuality, which
characterise the text of <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, wherein are found to
occur frequently Chinese equivalents for the ordinary concepts of an
entity, a being, a living being and a personality, the following
passage from <cite>The Bhagavad-Gita</cite>, suggestive almost of complete
harmony with the Buddhist doctrine, may serve to make even a cursory
consideration of the subject perhaps more illuminating. The passage,
rendered by Sir Edwin Arnold, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>There is ‘true’ Knowledge, Learn it thou in this:</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>To see one changeless Life in all the Lives,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>And in the Separate, One Inseparable.</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>The separate existences apart,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>And, being separated, holds them real.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Nirvana is only referred to casually in <cite>The Diamond Sutra</cite>, that
familiar Buddhist term hardly calls for any present detailed
explanation. Within a brief compass probably no better explanation may
be forthcoming than what is already given in this concise exposition
gathered from <cite>The Light of Asia</cite>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry3">
<div class="stanza2">
<div class="verse">“<i>If any teach Nirvana is to cease,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Say unto such they lie.</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>If any teach Nirvana is to live,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Say unto such they err; not knowing this,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Nor what light shines beyond their broken lamps,</i></div>
<div class="verse">&nbsp;<i>Nor lifeless, timeless bliss.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="mb1">In concluding, it might be opportune to observe, that the
<i>Werthurtheile</i>,<a id="Intro_FNanchor_48" href="#Intro_Fnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> known amongst modern theologians as characterising
the teaching of Albrecht Ritschl—sounds, upon intimate acquaintance,
merely as a faint echo of the logic of Sakyamuni Buddha. Ritschl might
apply his <i>Werthurtheile</i> to the presumed interpretation of a
“miracle,” etc. Buddha suggested by his “method,” that what is
ordinarily referred to as a “miracle,” is not in <em>reality</em> a “miracle,”
therefore it is merely <em>defined</em> as a “miracle.” So, also, with the
various dogmas which distinguish every religious creed. By many
Chinese it is regarded as an evidence of Divinity, that in the mind of
Sakyamuni Buddha there was conceived this incisive logical method; and
amongst the learned monks, profound homage is rendered, and much
wonder expressed, because the Lord Buddha<a id="Intro_FNanchor_49" href="#Intro_Fnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> did not hesitate to apply
its principles to every doctrine synonymous with his own accredited
“Law.”</p>

Dr Edkins, in his scholarly work <cite>Chinese Buddhism</cite>, seems
  to have regarded “the Law or body of doctrine” as an accurate

  by “Fah”—“Law”; and observed that it is “a general term for
  religious objects, especially for the Buddhistic Canon.”</p>


<p>  Mr Vincent A. Smith, in <cite>Asoka, Buddhist Emperor of India</cite>,

It may be interesting to observe that, according to our
  Chinese text, Sakyamuni Buddha evidently disclaimed any desire to
  formulate, or to perpetuate, a stereotyped system of “Law” or
  “doctrine.” Sakyamuni Buddha also made it plain, that the “Law”
  which he enunciated, was presented before the minds of his
  disciples in the simile of a “raft”—a thing to be abandoned when
  the mind “touched the further shore” of everlasting truth. It
  seems to be in this tentative sense that intellectual Buddhists
  regard all ecclesiastical institutions, priesthoods, dogmas,
  ordinances, etc.; and we have met monks who would classify
  belief in the “efficacy” of religious rites or ceremonies, with
  obnoxious forms of “heresy” and “immorality.” (Compare Rhys
  Davids’ <cite>Buddhism</cite>.) With regard to the Buddhist objection
  concerning the “efficacy” of religious “rites,” compare the noble
  sentiments expressed in the following lines, delightfully
  rendered by Sir Edwin Arnold from the <cite>Bhagavad-Gita</cite> (<cite>The Song

Rhys Davids, when he expounded the doctrine of Karma in

  whatever a man reaps, that he must also have sown.” Chinese
  Buddhists appear to be assured, “that if a man reaps sorrow,
  disappointment, pain, he himself, and no other, must at some time
  have sown folly, error, sin; and if not in this life, then in
  some former birth. Where then, in the latter case, is the
  identity between him who sows and him who reaps? <em>In that which
  alone remains</em> when a man dies, and the constituent parts of the
  sentient being are dissolved; in the result, namely, of his
  action, speech, and thought, in his good or evil <em>Karma</em>
  (literally his ‘doing’) which <em>does not</em> die.”</p>

  quiet place in the forest, and placed upon a stone for the birds

  is not to eat the whole of the food that he has received, but

By adopting the term <i>Mieh-Tu</i>, Chinese Buddhists appear well
  prepared to refute a prevalent notion that their concept of
  deliverance is equivalent to annihilation. <i>Mieh</i> usually means
  annihilation, but <i>Tu</i>—to cross over in safety, is the antithesis
  of annihilation. After due consideration of the significance of
  the terminology, perhaps it will be generally conceded that
  English renderings of <i>Mieh-Tu</i> as Deliverance or Salvation, are

The able commentator <i>Ti-Ching</i> observes that many people,
  like Ananda—a favourite disciple of Buddha—are in error when they
  suppose their minds to be located within their material bodies.
  This interesting aspect of Buddhist psychology is made tolerably
  clear in the familiar narrative known generally as <cite>The
  Enlightenment of Ananda</cite>. Therein the Lord Buddha endeavours to
  prove that as objects within ourselves are invisible, the
  illuminating mind cannot be asserted to inhabit exclusively our
  material bodies. He also indicates that it cannot be affirmed to
  occupy any appointed sphere outside ourselves, it being usually
  understood that we observe only those objects by which we are
  environed. The Lord Buddha also controverts the theory, enunciated
  by Ananda, that the mind is secreted somewhere within the organs
  of sense; which assumption is based upon a notion that the seeing
  eye, and differentiating mind, are mysteriously correlated.</p>

“This belief in self is regarded so distinctly as a heresy

  ‘the heresy of individuality,’ the name given to this belief as
  one of the three primary delusions (the others being doubt, and
  belief in the efficacy of rites or ceremonies) which must be
  abandoned at the very first stage of the Buddhist path of
  holiness. The other is Attavada, ‘the doctrine of soul or self,’
  which is the name given to it as a part of the chain of causes
  which lead to the origin of evil. It is there classed—with
  sensuality, heresy (as to eternity and annihilation), and belief

“Primitive Buddhism distinguished a material, visible, and

  of Law) as the constituents of every personality. This
  dichotomism, taught, as it seems by Sakyamuni himself, was ever
  afterwards retained as regards the nature of ordinary mortals. But
  in later ages, when the combined influence of Sivaism, which
  ascribed to Siva a threefold body (called <i>Dharmakaya</i>—essence,
  <i>Sambhogakaya</i>—reflex intelligence, and <i>Nirmanakaya</i>—practical
  issue of his intelligence), and that of Brahmanism with its
  Trimurti, gave rise to the Buddhist dogma of a Triratna
  (<i>San-Pao</i>—the precious Buddha, the precious Law, and the precious
  Priesthood), trichotomism was taught with regard to the nature of
  all Buddhas. Again they ascribed to every Buddha a triple form of

<p id="Ch_6_p1">Subhuti enquired of the Lord Buddha, saying: “Honoured of the Worlds!
In future ages, when this scripture is proclaimed, amongst those
beings destined to hear, shall any conceive within their minds a
sincere, unmingled faith?”<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_1" href="#Ch6_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p id="Ch_6_p2">The Lord Buddha replied to Subhuti, saying: “Have no such apprehensive
thought! Even at the remote period of five centuries subsequent to the
Nirvana of the Lord Buddha,<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_2" href="#Ch6_Fnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> there will be many disciples observing
the monastic vows,<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_3" href="#Ch6_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and assiduously devoted to good works.<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_4" href="#Ch6_Fnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> These,
hearing this scripture proclaimed, will believe in its immutability,
and similarly conceive within their minds a pure, unmingled faith.
Besides, it is important to realise that faith<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_5" href="#Ch6_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> thus conceived, is
not exclusively in virtue of the insular thought of any particular
Buddha, but because of its affiliation with the concrete<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_6" href="#Ch6_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> thoughts
of myriad Buddhas, throughout infinite ages. Therefore, amongst the
beings destined to hear this Scripture proclaimed, many, by momentary
reflection, will intuitively<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_7" href="#Ch6_Fnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> conceive a pure and holy faith.”</p>

<p>“Subhuti, the Lord Buddha by his prescience,<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_8" href="#Ch6_Fnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> is perfectly cognisant
of all such potential disciples, and for these also there is reserved
an immeasurable merit. And why? Because, the minds of these disciples
will not revert to such arbitrary concepts of phenomena as an entity,
a being, a living being, a personality, qualities or ideas coincident
with Law, or existing apart from the idea of Law. And why? Because,
assuming the permanency and reality of phenomena, the minds of these
disciples would be involved in such distinctive ideas as an entity, a
being, a living being, and a personality. Affirming the permanency and
reality of qualities or ideas coincident with Law, their minds would
inevitably be involved in resolving these same definitions.
Postulating the inviolate nature of qualities or ideas which have an
existence apart from the Law, there yet remain to be explained these
abstruse distinctions—an entity, a being, a living being, and a
personality. Therefore, enlightened disciples ought not to affirm the
permanency or reality of qualities or ideas coincident with Law, nor
postulate as being of an inviolate nature, qualities or ideas having
an existence apart from the concept of Law.”</p>

<p id="Ch_6_p4" class="mb1">“Thus, we are enabled to appreciate the significance of those words
which the Lord Buddha invariably repeated to his followers: ‘You
disciples must realise that the Law which I enunciated, was presented
before your minds in the simile of a raft.<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_9" href="#Ch6_Fnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> If the Law—having
fulfilled its function in bearing you to the other shore
(Nirvana)<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_10" href="#Ch6_Fnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>—with its coincident qualities and ideas must inevitably
be abandoned,<a id="Ch6_FNanchor_11" href="#Ch6_Fnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> how much more inevitable must be the abandonment of

  intellect; (2) That this potency can be rendered subjective by
  concentrated thought, ascetic exercises, or determined effort; (3)
  That this potency can only be acquired by the initiated; (4) That
  the initiated may enlarge this potency to a limitless extent. As
  to the efficient cause of the potency, there would be a difference

saying: “No! Honoured of the Worlds! And why? Because, Scrotapatti is
simply a descriptive term signifying ‘having entered the stream.’ A
disciple who avoids the seductive phenomena of form, sound, odour,
taste, touch, and Law,<a id="Ch9_FNanchor_3" href="#Ch9_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> is named a Scrotapatti.”</p>

title denoting ‘only one more reincarnation’;<a id="Ch9_FNanchor_5" href="#Ch9_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> but in reality there

thus reflect within himself, ‘I have obtained the fruits which accord

meaning ‘immunity from reincarnation’; but in reality there is no such
condition as ‘immunity from reincarnation,’ hence Anagami is merely a
convenient designation.”</p>

thus meditate within himself, ‘I have obtained the condition of an

why? Because, there is not in reality a condition synonymous with the
term Arhat. Honoured of the Worlds! if an Arhat thus meditates within
himself, ‘I have obtained the condition of an Arhat,’ there would be
obvious recurrence of such arbitrary concepts as an entity, a being, a

‘I have obtained the condition of an Arhat,’<a id="Ch9_FNanchor_11" href="#Ch9_Fnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> the ‘Honoured of the

“Explained by <i>Fuh-Ko</i>—the Fruit of Buddha (Buddhaphalam). The
  original meaning of Arhat (deserving, worthy) is overlooked by
  most Chinese commentators, who explained the term as if it were
  written <i>Ari-Hat</i>—Destroyer of the Enemy. The following two
  explanations are given, <i>Shah-Tseh</i>—Destroying the Enemy, and
  <i>Puh-Seng</i>—not to be reborn, <i>i.e.</i>, except from transmigration.
  There is, however, a third explanation which is based on the
  original meaning of Arhat, namely <i>Ying-Kong</i>—deserving worship.
  The Arhat is the perfected Arya (one who has mastered the four
  spiritual truths—<i>Sz-Ti</i>—and thereby entered the path to Nirvana
  called Arya-Marga), and the state of Arhat can accordingly be
  attained only by passing through the different degrees of
  saintship. Arhatship implies possession of supernatural powers,
  and is to be succeeded either by Buddhaship or by immediate
  entrance into Nirvana.”—<cite>Handbook of Chinese Buddhism</cite>. <span class="smcap">Eitel</span>.</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha, continuing, addressed Subhuti, saying: “Enlightened

holy mind; they ought not to depend on the phenomena of form, sound,
odour, taste, touch, or Law; they ought to sedulously cultivate a mind
independent of every material aid.”</p>

esteem such a body as being great?” Subhuti replied, saying:
“Exceedingly great, Honoured of the Worlds! And why? Because, the Lord
Buddha referred not to a physical body,<a id="Ch10_FNanchor_6" href="#Ch10_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> but to mental and spiritual
concepts of bodies, in which sense a body may be regarded as really
Great.”</p>

“The modification which Buddhism introduced into the idea of
  transmigration was necessitated by the early Buddhist theories of
  the nature of sentient beings; according to which, man consists of
  an assemblage of different properties or qualities ... these are
  Material qualities, Sensations, abstract Ideas, Tendencies of
  mind, and mental Powers.... The first group, Material Qualities,
  are like a mass of foam, that gradually forms, and then vanishes.
  The second group, the Sensations, are like a bubble dancing on the
  face of the water. The third group, the Ideas, are like the
  uncertain mirage that appears in the sunshine. The fourth group,
  the mental and moral Predispositions, are like the plantain stalk,
  without firmness or solidity. And the last group, the Thoughts,
  are like a spectre or magical illusion. The body itself is
  constantly changing, ... man is never the same for two consecutive
  moments.” (Compare Rhys Davids’ <cite>Buddhism</cite>, and Spence Hardy’s

  large? Subhuti said, Yes! his selfhood would be large. And why?

<p>Upon that occasion, the venerable Subhuti, hearing the text of this

transcendent wisdom, Honoured of the Worlds! The Lord Buddha in
expounding this supreme canon of Scripture, surpassed in perspicuity
every exposition previously heard by me, since my eyes<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_1" href="#Ch14_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> were
privileged to perceive this most excellent wisdom. Honoured of the
Worlds! In years to come, if disciples hearing this scripture
proclaimed, and having within their minds a pure and holy faith,
engender true concepts of the ephemeral nature of phenomena—we ought
to realise that the cumulative merit of such disciples will be
intrinsic and wonderful. Honoured of the Worlds! The true concept of
phenomena is, that these are not essentially phenomena, and hence the
Lord Buddha declared that they are merely termed phenomena.”</p>

<p>“Honoured of the Worlds! having heard this unprecedented Scripture,
faith, clear understanding, and firm resolve to observe its precepts,
follow as a natural sequence. If, in future ages, disciples destined
to hear this Scripture, likewise believe, understand, and observe its
precepts, their merit will incite the highest wonder and praise.<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_2" href="#Ch14_Fnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
And why? Because, the minds of those disciples<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_3" href="#Ch14_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> will have outgrown
such arbitrary ideas of phenomena as an entity, a being, a living
being, or a personality. And why? Because, the entity is in reality
non-entity; and a being, a living being, or a personality, are ideas
equally nebulous and hypothetical.<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_4" href="#Ch14_Fnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Wherefore, discarding every
arbitrary idea of phenomena, the wise and wholly enlightened were
severally designated Buddha.”<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_5" href="#Ch14_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The Lord Buddha, assenting, said unto Subhuti: “If, in future ages,
disciples destined to hear this Scripture, neither become perturbed by
its extreme modes of thought,<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_6" href="#Ch14_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> nor alarmed by its lofty
sentiments,<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_7" href="#Ch14_Fnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> nor apprehensive about realising its high
ideals<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_8" href="#Ch14_Fnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>—these disciples also, by their intrinsic merit, will incite
superlative wonder and praise.”</p>

<p id="Ch_14_p4">“Subhuti, what the Lord Buddha referred to as the first <i>Paramita</i><a id="Ch14_FNanchor_9" href="#Ch14_Fnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
(charity), is not in reality the first <i>Paramita</i>, it is merely termed
the first <i>Paramita</i>”</p>

<p id="Ch_14_p5">“Subhuti, regarding the third <i>Paramita</i> (endurance), it is not in
reality a <i>Paramita</i>, it is merely termed a <i>Paramita</i>. And why?
Because, in a previous life, when the Prince of Kalinga<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_10" href="#Ch14_Fnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
(‘Kaliradja’) severed the flesh from my limbs and body, at that time I
was oblivious to such arbitrary ideas of phenomena as an entity, a
being, a living being, or a personality. And why? Because, upon that
occasion, when my limbs and body were rent asunder, had I not been
oblivious to such arbitrary ideas as an entity, a being, a living
being, or a personality, there would have originated within my mind,
feelings of anger and resentment.”</p>

<p id="Ch_14_p6">“Subhuti, five hundred incarnations ago,<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_11" href="#Ch14_Fnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> I recollect that as a
recluse practising the ordinances of the Kshanti-Paramita,<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_12" href="#Ch14_Fnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> even
then I had no such arbitrary ideas as an entity, a being, a living
being, or a personality. Therefore, Subhuti, an enlightened disciple
ought to discard as being unreal and illusive, every conceivable form
of phenomena.<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_13" href="#Ch14_Fnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> In aspiring to supreme spiritual wisdom, the mind
ought to be insensible to every sensuous influence, and independent of
everything pertaining to sound, odour, taste, touch, or Law. There
ought to be cultivated a condition of complete independence of mind;
because, if the mind is depending upon any external aid, it is
obviously deluded—there is in reality nothing external to depend
upon.<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_14" href="#Ch14_Fnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Therefore, the Lord Buddha declared that in the exercise of
charity, the mind of an enlightened disciple ought not to depend upon
any form of phenomena. Subhuti, an enlightened disciple desirous to
confer benefits upon the whole realm of being, ought thus to be
animated in the exercise of charity.”<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_15" href="#Ch14_Fnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The Lord Buddha, in declaring the “unreality of phenomena,” also
affirmed “that the whole realm of sentient life is ephemeral and
illusory.”<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_16" href="#Ch14_Fnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>“Subhuti, the sayings of the Lord Buddha are true, credible, and
immutable. His utterances are neither extravagant nor chimerical.
Subhuti, the plane<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_17" href="#Ch14_Fnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of thought to which the Lord Buddha attained,
cannot be explained in terms synonymous with reality or
non-reality.”</p>

<p>“Subhuti, in the exercise of charity, if the mind of an enlightened
disciple is not independent of every Law, he is like unto a person
having entered impenetrable darkness, and to whom every object is
invisible. But an enlightened disciple, discharging the exercise of
charity with a mind independent of every Law, is like unto a person
having the power of vision, in the meridian glory of the sunlight, and
to whom every object is visible.”</p>

<p class="mb1">“Subhuti, in future ages, if a good disciple, whether man or woman,
rigorously studies and observes the text of this Scripture; the Lord
Buddha, by means of his Buddhic wisdom,<a id="Ch14_FNanchor_18" href="#Ch14_Fnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> entirely knows and
perceives that for such a disciple there is reserved a cumulative
merit, immeasurable and illimitable.”</p>

<p>It is recorded that the Lord Buddha, in a previous incarnation,
  was living in a mountainous region, strictly observing the

  having organised a hunting expedition, visited the secluded
  region, accompanied by numerous ladies of his harem. Fatigued by
  the excitement of the chase, the prince fell into a deep siesta.
  Meantime, the ladies resolved upon a short excursion along a
  mountain path. Unexpectedly meeting the Lord Buddha, they were
  greatly astonished at his dignified bearing and edifying
  conversation. When the prince awoke from his siesta, he was
  irritated to find that his ladies had disappeared. Instituting an
  immediate search, he became filled with implacable rage upon
  discovering them in the society of a hermit. The incident, as

sacrificed lives innumerable as the sands of the Ganges, and thus
without intermission throughout infinite ages; and if another
disciple, hearing this Scripture proclaimed, steadfastly believed it,
his felicity would be appreciably greater than the other. But how much
greater must be the felicity of a disciple who transcribes the sacred
text, observes its precepts, studies its Laws, and repeats the
Scripture that others may be edified thereby?”</p>

<p>“Subhuti, the relative importance of this Scripture may thus be

its merit interminable.”</p>

I served and received religious instruction, my conduct being entirely

idea of sentient life, there is <i>no one</i> to whom the idea of
sentient life has become oblivious.’<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_3" href="#Ch17_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> And why? Because, Subhuti, if
an enlightened disciple retains within his mind such arbitrary ideas
of sentient life as an entity, a being, a living being, or a
personality, he has not attained to supreme spiritual wisdom. And why?
Because, Subhuti, there is no Law by means of which a disciple may be
defined as one having obtained supreme spiritual wisdom.”<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_4" href="#Ch17_Fnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p id="Ch_17_p3">The Lord Buddha addressed Subhuti, saying: “What think you? When the
Lord Buddha was a disciple of Dipankara Buddha, was there bequeathed
to him any Law whereby he attained to supreme spiritual wisdom?”
Subhuti replied, saying: “No! Honoured of the Worlds! inasmuch as I am
able to comprehend the meaning of the Lord Buddha’s discourse, when
the Lord Buddha was a disciple of Dipankara Buddha, there was no Law
bequeathed to him whereby he attained to supreme spiritual wisdom.”</p>

<p id="Ch_17_p4">The Lord Buddha endorsed these words, saying:<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_5" href="#Ch17_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> “Truly there is no
Law by means of which the Lord Buddha obtained supreme spiritual
wisdom. Subhuti, if there existed a Law by means of which the Lord
Buddha obtained supreme spiritual wisdom, Dipankara Buddha would not
have foretold at my initiation, ‘In future ages<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_6" href="#Ch17_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> thou shalt become
Sakyamuni Buddha.’ But, in reality, there is no Law by means of which
supreme spiritual wisdom can be obtained. Therefore, at my initiation,
Dipankara Buddha foretold concerning me, ‘In future ages, thou shalt
become Sakyamuni Buddha.’ And why? Because, in the word
<i>Buddha</i>.<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_7" href="#Ch17_Fnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> every Law is summarily and intelligibly
comprehended.” “If a disciple affirmed that the Lord Buddha attained
to supreme spiritual wisdom, it is necessary to state that there is no
Law whereby this condition of mind can be realised. The supreme
spiritual wisdom to which the Lord Buddha attained, cannot, in its
essence, be defined as real or unreal. Thus, the Lord Buddha declared
that the ordinarily accepted term, ‘the Buddhic Law,’ is synonymous
with every moral and spiritual Law. Subhuti, what are ordinarily
declared to be ‘systems of Law,’ are not in reality ‘systems of Law,’
they are merely termed ‘systems of Law.’”</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha enquired of Subhuti, saying: “Can you imagine a man
having a great physical body?” Subhuti replied, saying: “The Lord
Buddha, discoursing upon the proportions of a physical body, did not
maintain for these any <em>real</em> greatness, therefore it is merely termed
‘a great body.”’</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha, thereupon, addressed Subhuti, saying: “Thus it is
with an enlightened disciple: if he were to expatiate after this
manner, ‘I must become oblivious to every idea of sentient life,’<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_8" href="#Ch17_Fnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
he could not be described as fully enlightened. And why? Because,
there is no Law whereby a disciple can be approved as ‘fully
enlightened.’<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_9" href="#Ch17_Fnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Therefore, the Lord Buddha declared that within the
realm of spiritual Law, there is neither an entity, a being, a living
being, nor a personality.”</p>

<p id="Ch_17_p7" class="mb1">The Lord Buddha addressed Subhuti, saying: “If an enlightened disciple
were to speak in this wise, ‘I shall create numerous Buddhist
kingdoms,’ he could not be designated ‘fully enlightened.’ And why?
Because, the Lord Buddha, discoursing upon ‘creating numerous Buddhist
kingdoms,’ did not affirm the idea of creating numerous ‘material’
Buddhist kingdoms, hence the ‘creation of numerous Buddhist kingdoms’
is merely a figure of speech. Subhuti, the Lord Buddha declared that a
disciple may be regarded as ‘truly enlightened,’ whose mind is
thoroughly imbued with the Law of non-individuality.”<a id="Ch17_FNanchor_10" href="#Ch17_Fnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

Most writers on the Buddhist faith and religion have occasion
  to refer to the series of events which culminated in the Lord
  Buddha obtaining “supreme enlightenment.” The founder of the
  Buddhist faith, dissatisfied with the practice of asceticism, and
  disappointed by his unfaithful disciples, walked meditatively
  towards the river Nairanjara, where Sujata, “the daughter of a
  neighbouring villager,” provided him with his morning meal.
  Seating himself under a sacred Bo-Tree, immediately he became
  engaged in the severest of mental conflicts. The Buddhist authors
  describe their Master as sitting “sublime,” “calm,” and “serene”
  throughout the sustained assault of a “visible” and wicked
  tempter, assisted by legions of evil spirits. So unrelenting was
  the fierce encounter, that the forces of nature shook and were
  convulsed under the dreadful onslaught. As the day advanced, the
  spiritual elements in Buddha’s nature gradually gained the
  ascendency; and when he became “fully enlightened,” there was
  revealed to him an antidote for human woe. The mind of the Lord
  Buddha thereafter assumed an aspect of perfect peace; “and in <em>the
  power over the human heart of inward culture, and of love to
  others</em>,” the great Teacher discovered a foundation of Truth,
  where, with assurance of faith, he could securely rest. As Milton
  regarded “Paradise” to be “regained” in the wilderness, and not on
  Calvary; in like manner the Buddhist poets indicate a belief that
  the experience of their Master under the Bo-Tree was the most
  eventful in his history. That is the reason they regard the
  Bo-Tree with a reverence resembling the Christian veneration of
  the Cross. (Compare Davids’ <cite>Buddhism</cite>.)</p>

<p>The familiar word Buddha, seems to convey to devout Buddhist
  minds, a meaning consonant with the ethical idea of Love, as
  understood generally by the followers of Christ. Within it are
  potential spiritual elements, which, according to their judgment,
  perfectly fulfil the Law. The Chinese text, <i>Ju-Lai-che,
  chi-chu-fah-ru-i</i>, may bear the following interpretation, <i>Buddha
  is the One in whom all Laws become intelligible</i>. With this
  particular definition before us, and bearing in mind the general
  substance of the Mahayana faith, we may perhaps appreciate the
  sense in which the distinguished missionary, Dr Richard of
  Shanghai, ventured to render the Chinese term <i>Ju-Lai</i> (Buddha),
  in a translation of Asvaghocha’s <cite>The Awakening of Faith</cite>, by the
  English synonym God. Few Christians would controvert the statement

“Bhagavat said, and a belief in matter itself, O Subhuti, is

<p>“Subhuti, this characteristic of the one ‘harmonious principle,’
  is a thing which cannot be spoken of in words; it is only the vain
  philosophy of the world, which has grasped the idea of explaining
  this.”—<cite>Kin-Kong-King</cite>. <span class="smcap">Beal</span>.</p>

<p>This noteworthy statement seems to militate against some opinions
  expressed in Europe regarding the Buddhist theory of “matter.”
  According to our Chinese text, it does not appear that Sakyamuni
  Buddha categorically denied the “presence” or “existence” of
  matter in the universe, but endeavoured rather to indicate the
  diversified and evanescent nature of its “forms” and “qualities.”
  Many devout Buddhists regard even the smallest particle of dust as
  containing a mysterious and elusive element—probably what we are
  disposed to term “a spiritual element,” or “principle of life”—and
  these are not unreasonably regarded as being altogether
  inscrutable, and therefore “incomprehensible.”</p>

<p id="Ch_31" class="chapter">[Chapter 31]</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha addressed Subhuti, saying: “If a disciple affirmed
that the Lord Buddha enunciated a belief<a id="Ch31_FNanchor_1" href="#Ch31_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> that the mind can
comprehend the idea of an entity, a being, a living being, or a
personality; what think you, Subhuti, would that disciple be
interpreting aright the meaning of my discourse?” Subhuti replied,
saying: “Honoured of the Worlds! that disciple would not be
interpreting aright the meaning of the Lord Buddha’s discourse. And
why? Because, Honoured of the Worlds! discoursing upon comprehending
such ideas as an entity, a being, a living being, and a personality,
it was declared that these are entirely unreal and illusive, and
therefore they are merely termed an entity, a being, a living being,
and a personality.”</p>

<p class="mb1">The Lord Buddha thereafter addressed Subhuti, saying:<a id="Ch31_FNanchor_2" href="#Ch31_Fnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> “Those who
aspire to the attainment of supreme spiritual wisdom ought thus to
know, believe in, and interpret phenomena. They ought to eliminate
from their minds every tangible evidence of every visible object.
Subhuti, concerning ‘visible objects,’ the Lord Buddha declared that
these are not really ‘visible objects’ they are merely termed ‘visible
objects.’”</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Ch31_Fnote_1" href="#Ch31_FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
“Because, O Subhuti, if a man were to say that belief in self,
  belief in a being, belief in life, belief in personality, had been
  preached by the Tathagata, would he be speaking truly? Subhuti
  said, not indeed, Bhagavat, he would not be speaking truly. And
  why? Because, what was preached by the Tathagata as a belief in
  self, that was preached as no-belief, therefore it is called
  belief in self.”—<cite>The Vagrakkhedika</cite>. <span class="smcap">Max Müller</span>.</p>

<p>In these words are exemplified another profound aspect of Buddhist
  doctrine. Apart from interesting questions concerning the
  existence of an entity, a being, a living being, or a personality,
  another problem seems to arise regarding our ability to entirely
  perceive or “comprehend” those admitted abstract ideas. If we
  interpret aright the Buddhist doctrine, there are variously
  compounded within those abstract ideas, so many elusive spiritual
  elements, that the human mind is incapable of resolving them by
  any process of reasoning. In short—an entity, a being, a living
  being, or a personality, represents to the Buddhist mind, much
  more than it attempts to express in terms of philosophy.</p>

<p><a id="Ch31_Fnote_2" href="#Ch31_FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
“Thus then, O Subhuti, are all things to be perceived, to be
  looked upon, and to be believed by one who has entered upon the
  path of the Bodhisattvas. And in this wise are they to be
  perceived, to be looked upon, and to be believed, neither in the
  idea of a thing, nor in the idea of a no-thing? And why? Because
  by saying: the idea of a thing, the idea of a thing indeed, it has
  been preached by the Tathagata as the no-idea of a thing.” — <cite>The
  Vagrakkhedika</cite>. <span class="smcap">Max Müller</span>.</p>

<p>“Subhuti, the persons who aspire to the perfectly enlightened
  heart, ought to know accordingly that this is true with respect to
  all things, and thus prevent the exhibition of any characteristics
  on any point whatever. Subhuti, these very characteristics of
  which we speak are after all no characteristics, but a mere
  name.”—<cite>Kin-Kong-King</cite>. <span class="smcap">Beal</span>.</p>

<p>The Lord Buddha addressed Subhuti, saying: “If a disciple, having
immeasurable spheres filled with the seven treasures,<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_1" href="#Ch32_Fnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> bestowed
these in the exercise of charity; and if a disciple, whether man or
woman, having aspired to supreme spiritual wisdom, selected from this
Scripture a stanza comprising four lines, then rigorously observed it,
studied it, and diligently explained it to others; the cumulative
merit of such a disciple would be relatively greater than the
other.”</p>

<p id="Ch_32_p2">“In what attitude of mind should it be diligently explained to
others?<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_2" href="#Ch32_Fnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Not assuming the permanency or the reality of earthly
phenomena, but in the conscious blessedness of a mind at perfect
rest.<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_3" href="#Ch32_Fnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> And why? Because, the phenomena of life may be likened unto a
dream, a phantasm, a bubble,<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_4" href="#Ch32_Fnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> a shadow, the glistening dew, or
lightning flash, and thus they ought to be contemplated.”</p>

<p class="mb1">When the Lord Buddha concluded his enunciation of this Scripture,<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_5" href="#Ch32_Fnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
the venerable Subhuti, the monks,<a id="Ch32_FNanchor_6" href="#Ch32_Fnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> nuns, lay-brethren and sisters,
all mortals, and the whole realm of spiritual beings, rejoiced
exceedingly, and consecrated to its practice, they received it and

“The wise man, the preacher, who wishes to expound this Sutra,
  must absolutely renounce falsehood, pride, calumny, and envy....
  He is always sincere, mild, forbearing; ... he must feel affection

  greatly perverted in their minds, those beings who do not hear,

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
